            <h2 id="title-name">Ada Lovelace</h2>
            <h3 id="subtitle-name">Born in 1815 - Died in 1852</h3>
            <p class="img-caption">Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician known to be a pioneer of computing science. Lovelace was the first to recognize the full potential of a 'computing machine', suggesting it had applications beyond pure calculations.
            <br><br> To call someone born in 1815 a computer scientist may seem a little bit odd, but despite the time that was truly what Ada Lovelace became.</p>

                <p class="tribute-info">Ada's mother, fearing that her daughter might inherit her father's moody and unpredictable temperament, decided that it would be a good option for her daughter to practice math and science from a really young age.</p>
                <p class="tribute-info">Around the age of 17 Ada met Charles Babbage, a mathematician and inventor of the difference engine, which was meant to perform mathematical calculations. Babbage acted as a mentor for Ada throughout the years, with his help Ada had the possibility of studying advanced mathematics in the University of London.</p>
                <p class="tribute-info">Lovelace got a chance to translate an article on Babbage's earlier invention, the analytical engine, designed to handle more complex calculations. While translating the article and adding her own thoughts she realized it was way longer than the original article, so she decided to publish her own work in an English science journal.</p>

            <div id="right-side">
                <p class="tribute-info">The article went unnoticed, after a while he went bankrupt despite her attempts of developing mathematical schemes to win at gambling, finally she died in 1852 thanks to uterine cancer. </p>
                <h3 class="tribute-info">Contributions</h3>
                <p class="tribute-info">In her article published in 1843, Lovelace explained how codes could be created for the device to handle letters, symbols and numbers, she also described her theories of how the engine could repat a series of instructions. This concept is now at days known as looping, often used in computer programs. </p>
                <p class="tribute-info">For this and more forward-thinking concepts written in her article, Augusta Ada Lovelace is considered to be the first computer programmer.</p>
